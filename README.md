# LangChain Experiments  

This repository contains my personal explorations with **LangChain**, a powerful framework for building applications powered by large‑language models (LLMs). Within this folder you’ll find examples, experiments, mini‑projects and key LangChain concepts: chat models, embedding models, prompt templates, structured output parsing, chains & runnables.

## What’s in here  

- **Chat Models & Embeddings** — Experimentation with different model types (chat & embedding) and how to leverage them for various tasks.  
- **Prompt Templates** — Designing reusable templates to prompt models effectively.  
- **Structured Output & Output Parsers** — Learning how to define output formats, parse model responses reliably, and enforce structure in results.  
- **Chains & Runnables** — Implementing multi‑step workflows: chaining components, composing tasks, and orchestrating logic via Runnables.  
- **Mini‑Projects** — Small end‑to‑end applications built using LangChain abstractions to solidify learning and showcase patterns.
